            <h2>3. How Your Data is Stored</h2>
            <p>All data generated by VoiceQuill is stored locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voice Processing:</strong> Audio is processed using your device's built-in speech recognition system. No audio is recorded or transmitted to our servers or any third party.</li>
                <li><strong>Transcriptions:</strong> All text transcriptions are stored in a local database (SQLite) on your device only.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> Your notes never leave your device unless you explicitly choose to share them using your device's sharing features.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. Permissions Required</h2>
            <p>VoiceQuill requires the following permission to function:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> Required to capture your voice for speech-to-text conversion. Audio is processed in real-time and is not stored or recorded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can revoke this permission at any time through your device settings, though this will prevent the app from functioning.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>VoiceQuill uses your device's native speech recognition system (provided by Google on Android devices). Please refer to Google's privacy policy for information about how they handle speech recognition:</p>
            <ul>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data. If you choose to use your device's sharing features (e.g., sharing a note via email or messaging), that sharing is handled by your device's operating system and the apps you choose to share with.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a secure device lock (PIN, password, or biometric)</li>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Being cautious about granting device access to others</li>
